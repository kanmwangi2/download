## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft indigo (#667EEA) for a calm and professional feel. This hue aligns with feelings of security, intelligence, and order. While dark blue can sometimes feel cold, indigo contains some red to create a balance.
- Background color: Dark, desaturated indigo (#2D3748) for the default dark mode. This works well with the primary indigo for a high-contrast yet professional scheme.
- Accent color: Pale blue (#A3BFFA) for interactive elements. This works because it is 30 degrees to the 'left' of indigo in hue; in addition, it contrasts the background color strongly, due to being lighter and more saturated.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern, and readable interface.
- Use consistent, professional-looking icons for navigation and actions.
- Maintain a consistent three-part layout with left navigation, top header, and central content area for all pages.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations for a smooth user experience when navigating and performing actions.
